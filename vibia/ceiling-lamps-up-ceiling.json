The Up ceiling lamp s bring together compelling design and LED technology with the aim of creating a refined and unique collection. This exploitation of lighting technology means that the installation can be surface mounted.\nEach of the four models that constitute the Up collection become part of the ceiling, bringing a sophisticated aesthetic that blends with its surroundings.\nVibia manufactures these ceiling lights in two colours: matt lacquered graphite and matt lacquered white.",

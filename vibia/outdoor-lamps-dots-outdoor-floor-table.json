	"description": "Diminutive, compact and easily integrated into any garden, Dots Outdoor is the perfect solution for a range of exterior low lighting needs. Each luminaire is carved with a rounded opening that reflects light from an internal source, creating a halo of ambient light like a radiant crown. The second versionâ€™s other side is closed, allowing the designer to play with the direction of light and ease any intensity.",

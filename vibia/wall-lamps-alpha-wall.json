	"description": "The designers Ramos & Bassols have created the Alpha lamps collection for Vibia. The Alpha collection is a grouping of small scale wall lights that are characterised by their refined silhouette. Vibia manufactures the Alpha lamp in two finishes: matt lacquered graphite and black as well as all matt lacquered white. All of the different components of the Alpha lamp collection are fitted with LED lights. The Alpha wall light is surface mounted and easily maintained and so therefore suitable for both private residential as well as contract projects.",

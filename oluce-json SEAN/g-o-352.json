				"Product Description": "The G.O. lamp is the revival edition of a model designed for Oluce by Giuseppe Ostuni in the 1960s. A lamp that, in the essence of its design, is extremely current, characterised by a vertical shaft from which a horizontal arm branches off and on which the lampshade is mounted. The arm, thanks to the system of joints, is therefore a sliding element that can be repositioned and oriented depending on specific needs."
